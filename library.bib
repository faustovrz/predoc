Our approach uses stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to test whether disease heritability is enriched in regions surrounding genes with the highest specific expression in a given tissue. We applied our approach to gene expression data from several sources together with GWAS summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits (average N = 169,331) and found significant tissue-specific enrichments (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%) for 34 traits. In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detected a broad range of enrichments that recapitulated known biology. In our brain-specific analysis, significant enrichments included an enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder, and excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index. Our results demonstrate that our polygenic approach is a powerful way to leverage gene expression data for interpreting GWAS signals.},

Genetic studies have provided firm evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte (Zea mays subspecies parviglumis), a wild relative that is endemic to the mid- to lowland regions of southwestern Mexico. An interesting paradox remains, however: Maize cultivars that are most closely related to Balsas teosinte are found mainly in the Mexican highlands where subspecies parviglumis does not grow. Genetic data thus point to primary diffusion of domesticated maize from the highlands rather than from the region of initial domestication. Recent archeological evidence for early lowland cultivation has been consistent with the genetics of domestication, leaving the issue of the ancestral position of highland maize unresolved. We used a new SNP dataset scored in a large number of accessions of both teosinte and maize to take a second look at the geography of the earliest cultivated maize. We found that gene flow between maize and its wild relatives meaningfully impacts our inference of geographic origins. By analyzing differentiation from inferred ancestral gene frequencies, we obtained results that are fully consistent with current ecological, archeological, and genetic data concerning the geography of early maize cultivation.},

Despite the importance of genetic contributions to historical yield increases, little is known about the underlying genomic changes. Here we use high-density SNP genotyping to characterize a set of North American maize lines spanning the history of modern breeding. We provide a unique analysis of genomewide developments in genetic diversity, ancestry, and selection. The genomic history of maize is marked by a steady increase in genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, whereas allele frequencies in the total population have remained relatively constant. These changes are associated with increasing genetic separation of breeding pools and decreased diversity in the ancestry of individual lines. We confirm that modern heterotic groups are the product of ongoing divergence from a relatively homogeneous landrace population, but show that differential landrace ancestry remains evident. Using a recent association approach, we characterize signals of directional selection throughout the genome, identifying a number of candidate genes of potential agronomic relevance. However, overall we find that selection has had limited impact on genome-wide patterns of diversity and ancestry, with little evidence for individual lines contributing disproportionately to the accumulation of favorable alleles in today's elite germplasm. Our data suggest breeding progress has mainly involved selection and recombination of relatively common alleles, contributed by a representative but limited set of ancestral lines.},

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more efficient program of P fertilization and breeding crop varieties with enhanced Pi uptake and use efficiency, which required understanding how plants respond to Pi starvation. To understand how maize plants adapt to P-deficiency stress, we screened 116 inbred lines in the field and identified two lines, DSY2 and DSY79 that were extreme low-P resistant and sensitive, respectively. We further conducted physiological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies using the roots of DSY2 and DSY79 under normal or low-P conditions. The results showed that the low-P resistant line, DSY2 had larger root length, surface area and volume, higher root vitality, as well as acid phosphatase activity as compared with the low-P sensitive line, DSY79 under the low-P condition. The transcriptomic and proteomic results suggest that dramatic more genes were induced in DSY2, including the plant hormone signaling, acid phosphatase, and metabolite genes, as compared with DSY79 after being challenged by low-P stress. The new insights generated in this study will be useful toward the improvement of P-utilize efficiency in maize.},

The GSDE is based on the Soil Map of the World and various regional and national soil databases, including soil attribute data and soil maps. We used a standardized data structure and data processing procedures to harmonize the data collected from various sources. We then used a soil type linkage method (i.e., taxotransfer rules) and a polygon linkage method to derive the spatial distribution of the soil properties. To aggregate the attributes of different compositions of a mapping unit, we used three mapping approaches: the area-weighting method, the dominant soil type method, and the dominant binned soil attribute method. The data set can also be aggregated to a lower resolution. In this paper, we only show the vertical and horizontal variations of sand, silt and clay contents, bulk density, and soil organic carbon as examples of the GSDE. The GSDE estimates of global soil organic carbon stock to the depths of 2.3, 1, and 0.3 m are 1922.7, 1455.4, and 720.1 Gt, respectively.

Under domestication, wild populations respond to shifting selective pressures, resulting in adaptation to the new ecological niche of cultivation. Due to the important role of domesticated crops in human nutrition and agriculture, the ancestry and selection pressures transforming a wild plant into a domesticate have been extensively studied. In Zea mays, morphological, genetic, and genomic studies have elucidated how a wild plant, the teosinte Zea mays subsp. parviglumis, was transformed into the domesticate Zea mays subsp. mays. Five major morphological differences distinguish these two subspecies, and careful genetic dissection has pinpointed the molecular changes responsible for several of these traits. But maize domestication was a consequence of more than just five genes, and regions throughout the genome contribute. The impacts of these additional regions are contingent on genetic background, both the interactions between alleles of a single gene and among alleles of the multiple genes that modulate phenotypes. Key genetic interactions include dominance relationships, epistatic interactions, and pleiotropic constraint, including how these variants are connected in gene networks. Here, we review the role of gene interactions in generating the dramatic phenotypic evolution seen in the transition from teosinte to maize.},

Landscape genomics is an emergent research area that uncovers genome–environment associations, thus allowing researchers to identify candidate loci for adaptation to specific environmental variables. In the present study, we used latent factor mixed models (LFMMs) and Moran spectral outlier detection/randomization (MSOD‐MSR) to identify candidate loci for adaptation to 10 environmental variables (climatic, soil and atmospheric) among 43 515 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 202 accessions of the model legume Medicago truncatula. Soil variables were associated with a large number of candidate loci identified through both LFMMs and MSOD‐MSR. Genes tagged by candidate loci associated with drought and salinity are involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses, while those tagged by candidates associated with soil nitrogen and atmospheric nitrogen, participate in the legume‐rhizobia symbiosis. Candidate SNPs identified through both LFMMs and MSOD‐MSR explained up to 56% of variance in flowering traits. Our findings highlight the importance of soil in driving adaptation in the system and elucidate the basis of evolutionary potential of M. truncatula to respond to global climate change and anthropogenic disruption of the nitrogen cycle.},

We use identity by descent and local ancestry inferred from genome-wide genetic data to estimate overall and ancestry-specific effective population size during the past hundred generations for nine admixed American populations from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, and for African-American and European-American populations from two US cities. In these populations, the estimated pre-admixture effective sizes of the ancestral populations vary by sampled population, suggesting that the ancestors of different sampled populations were drawn from different sub-populations. In addition, we estimate that overall effective population sizes dropped substantially in the generations immediately after the commencement of European and African immigration, reaching a minimum around 12 generations ago, but rebounded within a small number of generations afterwards. Of the populations that we considered, the population of individuals originating from Puerto Rico has the smallest bottleneck size of one thousand, while the Pittsburgh African-American population has the largest bottleneck size of two hundred thousand.},

  journal = {Annals of Botany}, 
  abstract = {Background Plants depend on their root systems to acquire the water and nutrients necessary for their survival in nature, and for their yield and nutritional quality in agriculture. Root systems are complex and a variety of root phenes have been identified as contributors to adaptation to soils with low fertility and aluminium (Al) toxicity. Phenotypic characterization of root adaptations to infertile soils is enabling plant breeders to develop improved cultivars that not only yield more, but also contribute to yield stability and nutritional security in the face of climate variability. Scope In this review the adaptive responses of root systems to soils with low fertility and Al toxicity are described. After a brief introduction, the purpose and focus of the review are outlined. This is followed by a description of the adaptive responses of roots to low supply of mineral nutrients [with an emphasis on low availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and on toxic levels of Al]. We describe progress in developing germplasm adapted to soils with low fertility or Al toxicity using selected examples from ongoing breeding programmes on food (maize, common bean) and forage/feed ( Brachiaria spp.) crops. A number of root architectural, morphological, anatomical and metabolic phenes contribute to the superior performance and yield on soils with low fertility and Al toxicity. Major advances have been made in identifying root phenes in improving adaptation to low N (maize), low P (common bean) or high Al [maize, common bean, species and hybrids of brachiariagrass, bulbous canarygrass ( Phalaris aquatica ) and lucerne ( Medicago sativa )]. Conclusions Advanced root phenotyping tools will allow dissection of root responses into specific root phenes that will aid both conventional and molecular breeders to develop superior cultivars. These new cultivars will play a key role in sustainable intensification of crop–livestock systems, particularly in smallholder systems of the tropics. Development of these new cultivars adapted to soils with low fertility and Al toxicity is needed to improve global food and nutritional security and environmental sustainability.},

  author = {Lynch, Jonathan P. and Brown, Kathleen M.}, 
  journal = {Plant and Soil}, 
  abstract = {Low phosphorus availability is a primary constraint to plant productivity in many natural and agricultural ecosystems. Plants display a wide array of adaptive responses to low phosphorus availability that generally serve to enhance phosphorus mobility in the soil and increase its uptake. One set of adaptive responses is the alteration of root architecture to increase phosphorus acquisition from the soil at minimum metabolic cost. In a series of studies with the common bean, work in our laboratory has shown that architectural traits that enhance topsoil foraging appear to be particularly important for genotypic adaptation to low phosphorus soils (‘phosphorus efficiency’). In particular, the gravitropic trajectory of basal roots, adventitious rooting, the dispersion of lateral roots, and the plasticity of these processes in response to phosphorus availability contribute to phosphorus efficiency in this species. These traits enhance the exploration and exploitation of shallow soil horizons, where phosphorus availability is greatest in many soils. Studies with computer models of root architecture show that root systems with enhanced topsoil foraging acquire phosphorus more efficiently than others of equivalent size. Comparisons of contrasting genotypes in controlled environments and in the field show that plants with better topsoil foraging have superior phosphorus acquisition and growth in low phosphorus soils. It appears that many architectural responses to phosphorus stress may be mediated by the plant hormone ethylene. Genetic mapping of these traits shows that they are quantitatively inherited but can be tagged with QTLs that can be used in plant breeding programs. New crop genotypes incorporating these traits have substantially improved yield in low phosphorus soils, and are being deployed in Africa and Latin America.},

This updated survey of the recent literature shows that the sequential fractionation proposed by Hedley et al. can also be used to separate forms of organically bound soil phosphorus from the geochemically bound fractions. We consider that biological P includes all the extracted organic fractions (Bicarb Po, NaOH o, sonic Po) and geochemical P includes the remaining fractions (Resin Pi, Bicarb Pi, NaOH Pi, sonic Pi, HCl Pi) and the Po and Pi in the Residual fraction.Data from the Hedley fractionation suggest that the contribution of geochemical versus biological processes to soil phosphorus availability varies with pedogenesis. The pool of primary phosphate declines and the NaOH and sonicated-NaOH phosphorus fractions increase as phosphorus becomes geochemically fixed to the iron and aluminum oxides in more highly weathered soils. The sum of organic-P fractions — biological P — is an increasing proportion of total available P as a function of soil development. Therefore, the Hedley fractionation provides a valuable index of the relative importance of biological processes to soil phosphorus content across a soil weathering gradient.},

Pi starvation reduced main root length and increased the number of lateral roots of Arabidopsis Columbia-0 seedlings. In combination with salt, low Pi dampened the inhibiting effect of mild salt stress (75 mm) on all measured RSA components. At higher salt concentrations, the Pi deprivation response prevailed over the salt stress only for lateral root elongation. The Pi deprivation response of lateral roots appeared to be oppositely affected by abscisic acid signaling compared with the salt stress response. Natural variation in the response to the combination treatment of salt and Pi starvation within 330 Arabidopsis accessions could be grouped into four response patterns. When exposed to double stress, in general, lateral roots prioritized responses to salt, while the effect on main root traits was additive. Interestingly, these patterns were not identical for all accessions studied, and multiple strategies to integrate the signals from Pi deprivation and salinity were identified. By genome-wide association mapping, 12 genomic loci were identified as putative factors integrating responses to salt stress and Pi starvation. From our experiments, we conclude that Pi starvation interferes with salt responses mainly at the level of lateral roots and that large natural variation exists in the available genetic repertoire of accessions to handle the combination of stresses.},

  abstract = {Zostera marina L. is an angiosperm that grows in a medium in which inorganic phosphate (Pi) and nitrate \((\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}})\) are present in micromolar concentrations and must be absorbed against a steep electrochemical potential gradient. The operation of a Na+-dependent \(\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}}\) transport was previously demonstrated in leaf cells of this plant, suggesting that other Na+-coupled systems could mediate the uptake of anions. To address this question, Pi transport was studied in leaves and roots of Z. marina, as well as \(\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}}\) uptake in roots. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that micromolar concentrations of Pi induced depolarizations of the plasma membrane of root cells. However, this effect was not observed in leaf cells. Pi-induced depolarizations showed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Km=1.5±0.6 μM Pi; Dmax=7.8±0.8 mV), and were not observed in the absence of Na+. However, depolarizations were restored when Na+ was resupplied. \(\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}}\) additions also evoked depolarizations of the plasma membrane of root cells only in the presence of Na+. Both \(\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}}\) - and Pi-induced depolarizations were accompanied by an increase in cytoplasmic Na+ activity, detected by Na+-sensitive microelectrodes. Pi net uptake (measured in depletion experiments) was stimulated by Na+. These results strongly suggest that Pi uptake in roots of Z. marina is mediated by a high-affinity Na+-dependent transport system. Both \(\mathrm\{NO}_\{3}^\{\{-}}\) and Pi transport systems exploit the steep inwardly directed electrochemical potential gradient for Na+, considering the low cytoplasmic Na+ activity (10.7±3.3 mM Na+) and the high external Na+ concentration (500 mM Na+).},

  abstract = {Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile is a seagrass, the only group of vascular plants to colonize the marine environment. Seawater is an extreme yet stable environment characterized by high salinity, alkaline pH and low availability of essential nutrients, such as nitrate and phosphate. Classical depletion experiments, membrane potential and cytosolic sodium measurements were used to characterize the high-affinity NO3−, Pi and amino acids uptake mechanisms in this species. Net uptake rates of both NO3− and Pi were reduced by more than 70% in the absence of Na+. Micromolar concentrations of NO3− depolarized mesophyll leaf cells plasma membrane. Depolarizations showed saturation kinetics (Km = 8.7 ± 1 μM NO3−), which were not observed in the absence of Na+. NO3− induced depolarizations at increasing Na+ also showed saturation kinetics (Km = 7.2 ± 2 mM Na+). Cytosolic Na+ measured in P. oceanica leaf cells (17 ± 2 mM Na+) increased by 0.4 ± 0.2 mM Na+ upon the addition of 100 μM NO3−. Na+-dependence was also observed for high-affinity l-ala and l-cys uptake and high-affinity Pi transport. All together, these results strongly suggest that NO3−, amino acids and Pi uptake in P. oceanica leaf cells are mediated by high-affinity Na+-dependent transport systems. This mechanism seems to be a key step in the process of adaptation of seagrasses to the marine environment.},

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.},

  abstract = {P-removal from soil solution is mainly due to adsorption and precipitation reactions. For calcareous soils two pathways have been proposed as being relevant: partitioning on soil surfaces and precipitation induced by Ca2+ ions in solution. To define P-speciation in soil and reduce P-immobilisation following fertilisation, the relative importance of these two reactions needs to be quantitatively established. This investigation, conducted on two calcareous soils, suggests that Ca-ion activity in the liquid phase is mainly responsible for the formation of insoluble Ca-P phases. Our study was carried out by determining: a) batch sorption isotherms at different slurry concentrations, times of contact, pH and indifferent electrolyte concentrations; b) supernatant isotherms on soil suspensions; c) insolubilisation kinetics of P added to soil columns. The shape of the sorption isotherms indicated that adsorption predominated at low concentrations (below approximately 0.5 mM); above this level precipitation became predominant. Precipitation from solution was demonstrated by adding increasing amounts of phosphate to soil suspension supernatants and precipitation levels comparable to those observed in sorption isotherms were obtained. Thus, carbonate mineral surfaces were not necessary for the induction of P precipitation. The formation of Ca-P mineral phases was increased with reaction time and was governed by the concentration of Ca-ions, pH and indifferent electrolyte concentration. P added at the top of soil columns was rapidly insolubilised: after 5 weeks the P-Olsen value was reduced to about 60% and P was not transported to the deepest layers but remained in the surface ones. These results suggest that, for soils with a high reservoir of exchangeable cations able to form insoluble P phases, precipitation is the predominant mechanism which reduces P availability for plants.},

Moreover, global P-reserves may last for only several more generations. Cutting down on the use of P-fertilizers therefore is important, and to ultimately do so it is crucial to understand how plants sense, signal, respond to and cope with P-limitation, to determine the genes and molecular mechanisms involved, and to apply the knowledge to improve P-acquisition and P-use efficiency (PAE, PUE) of crop plant species. This chapter provides an overview of the players involved in plant P-status signalling/sensing, and outlines the approaches used to increase PAE/PUE on the basis of understanding the plant P-starvation response and the underlying signalling pathways and networks.},

This review describes how the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana adapts its root system architecture to phosphate deficiency through inhibition of primary root growth, increase in lateral root formation and growth and production of root hairs, which all promote topsoil foraging. A better understanding of plant adaptation to low phosphate will open the way to increased phosphorus use efficiency by crops. Such an improvement is needed in order to adjust how we manage limited phosphorus stocks and to reduce the disastrous environmental effects of phosphate fertilizers overuse.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizas play a pivotal role in phosphorus (P) acquisition of plant roots, by enhancing the soil volume that can be explored. Non-mycorrhizal plant species typically occur either in relatively fertile soil or on soil with a very low P availability, where there is insufficient P in the soil solution for mycorrhizal hyphae to be effective. Soils with a very low P availability are either old and severely weathered or relatively young with high concentrations of oxides and hydroxides of aluminium and iron that sorb P. In such soils, cluster roots and other specialised roots that release P-mobilising carboxylates are more effective than mycorrhizas. Cluster roots are ephemeral structures that release carboxylates in an exudative burst. The carboxylates mobilise sparingly-available sources of soil P. The relative investment of biomass in cluster roots and the amount of carboxylates that are released during the exudative burst differ between species on severely weathered soils with a low total P concentration and species on young soils with high total P concentrations but low P availability. Taking a modelling approach, we explore how the optimal cluster-root strategy depends on soil characteristics, thus offering insights for plant breeders interested in developing crop plants with optimal cluster-root strategies. },

  abstract = {Climate is predicted to change over the 21st century. However, little is known about how climate change can affect soil phosphorus (P) cycle and availability in global terrestrial ecosystems, where P is a key limiting nutrient. With a global database of Hedley P fractions and key‐associated physiochemical properties of 760 (seminatural) natural soils compiled from 96 published studies, this study evaluated how climate pattern affected soil P cycle and availability in global terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, soil available P, indexed by Hedley labile inorganic P fraction, significantly decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP). Hypothesis‐oriented path model analysis suggests that MAT negatively affected soil available P mainly by decreasing soil organic P and primary mineral P and increasing soil sand content. MAP negatively affected soil available P both directly and indirectly through decreasing soil primary mineral P; however, these negative effects were offset by the positive effects of MAP on soil organic P and fine soil particles, resulting in a relatively minor total MAP effect on soil available P. As aridity degree was mainly determined by MAP, aridity also had a relatively minor total effect on soil available P. These global patterns generally hold true irrespective of soil depth (≤10 cm or >10 cm) or site aridity index (≤1.0 or >1.0), and were also true for the low‐sand (≤50%) soils. In contrast, available P of the high‐sand (>50%) soils was positively affected by MAT and aridity and negatively affected by MAP. Our results suggest that temperature and precipitation have contrasting effects on soil P availability and can interact with soil particle size to control soil P availability. Soil phosphorus cycle is an important component of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles; however, little is known about climatic effects on soil phosphorus cycle. We evaluated how climate pattern affected soil phosphorus dynamics and availability in natural terrestrial ecosystems using a global database of soil phosphorus fractions. Our results suggest that temperature and precipitation have contrasting effects on soil phosphorus dynamics and can interact with soil particle size to control soil phosphorus availability.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a major element required for biological activity in terrestrial ecosystems. Although the total P content in most soils can be large, only a small fraction is available or in an organic form for biological utilization because it is bound either in incompletely weathered mineral particles, adsorbed on mineral surfaces, or, over the time of soil formation, made unavailable by secondary mineral formation (occluded). In order to adequately represent phosphorus availability in global biogeochemistry–climate models, a representation of the amount and form of P in soils globally is required. We develop an approach that builds on existing knowledge of soil P processes and databases of parent material and soil P measurements to provide spatially explicit estimates of different forms of naturally occurring soil P on the global scale. We assembled data on the various forms of phosphorus in soils globally, chronosequence information, and several global spatial databases to develop a map of total soil P and the distribution among mineral bound, labile, organic, occluded, and secondary P forms in soils globally. The amount of P, to 50cm soil depth, in soil labile, organic, occluded, and secondary pools is 3.6 ± 3, 8.6 ± 6, 12.2 ± 8, and 3.2 ± 2 Pg P (Petagrams of P, 1 Pg = 1 × 1015g) respectively. The amount in soil mineral particles to the same depth is estimated at 13.0 ± 8 Pg P for a global soil total of 40.6 ± 18 Pg P. The large uncertainty in our estimates reflects our limited understanding of the processes controlling soil P transformations during pedogenesis and a deficiency in the number of soil P measurements. In spite of the large uncertainty, the estimated global spatial variation and distribution of different soil P forms presented in this study will be useful for global biogeochemistry models that include P as a limiting element in biological production by providing initial estimates of the available soil P for plant uptake and microbial utilization.},

The generality of local adaptation in plants and whether and how it is influenced by specific species, population and habitat characteristics have, however, not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, we examined published data on the outcomes of reciprocal transplant experiments using two approaches. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the performance of local and foreign plants at all transplant sites. In addition, we analysed frequencies of pairs of plant origin to examine whether local plants perform better than foreign plants at both compared transplant sites. In both approaches, we also examined the effects of population size, and of the habitat and species characteristics that are predicted to affect local adaptation. We show that, overall, local plants performed significantly better than foreign plants at their site of origin: this was found to be the case in 71.0% of the studied sites. However, local plants performed better than foreign plants at both sites of a pair-wise comparison (strict definition of local adaption) only in 45.3% of the 1032 compared population pairs. Furthermore, we found local adaptation much more common for large plant populations (>1000 flowering individuals) than for small populations (<1000 flowering individuals) for which local adaptation was very rare. The degree of local adaptation was independent of plant life history, spatial or temporal habitat heterogeneity, and geographic scale. Our results suggest that local adaptation is less common in plant populations than generally assumed. Moreover, our findings reinforce the fundamental importance of population size for evolutionary theory. The clear role of population size for the ability to evolve local adaptation raises considerable doubt on the ability of small plant populations to cope with changing environments.},

  abstract = {Studies of local adaptation provide important insights into the power of natural selection relative to gene flow and other evolutionary forces. They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme × habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation – divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

A Mendelian population, defined as a group of individuals who reproduce sexually or are potentially capable of doing so, focuses on the evolutionary dimension and differs therefore fundamentally from other disciplines like general ecology or demography. Nevertheless, it is but a theoretical notion. In reality, a biological population has moving and permeable boundaries which are intimately linked with cultural and social factors.

Methods In a prospective trial 34 patients (34.0 ± 8.4 years; 25 males, 9 females) were treated with a minimal invasive additive technique using composite restorations. The restorative treatment protocol was to provide all teeth with composite build-up restorations in an increased vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) using the DSO-technique. Recall appointments were planned after 1 month, 1 and 3 years after treatment. Restorations were scored for clinically acceptability (FDI-criteria) and scores 4 and 5 were recorded as clinically unacceptable. Frequencies of failures and Kaplan Meier survival curves are presented and effect of relevant variables was calculated with a multifactorial Cox regression (p < 0.05). Results 1256 Restorations were placed, 687 anterior, 324 premolar, and 245 molar restorations. After a mean observation time of 39.7 months a total of 69 failures were observed, of which 61 restorations were repaired (score 4) and 8 were replaced (score 5). Most common reasons for failure were (chip) fractures (n = 43) and caries (n = 11). Placement of anterior restorations in two sessions led to significant 4.6 times more failures then placed in one session. Conclusions In patients with severe tooth wear a full rehabilitation, in an increased vertical dimension of occlusion, direct composite resin restorations show a 94.8% success and 99.3% survival rate after a period of 3.5 years.},

Fisher proved his fundamental theorem of natural selection, providing a model in which the rate of change of mean fitness is equal to the genetic variance of a species. Fisher did not include mutations in his model, but believed that mutations would provide a continual supply of variance resulting in perpetual increase in mean fitness, thus providing a foundation for neo-Darwinian theory. In this paper we re-examine Fisher’s Theorem, showing that because it disregards mutations, and because it is invalid beyond one instant in time, it has limited biological relevance. We build a differential equations model from Fisher’s first principles with mutations added, and prove a revised theorem showing the rate of change in mean fitness is equal to genetic variance plus a mutational effects term. We refer to our revised theorem as the fundamental theorem of natural selection with mutations. Our expanded theorem, and our associated analyses (analytic computation, numerical simulation, and visualization), provide a clearer understanding of the mutation–selection process, and allow application of biologically realistic parameters such as mutational effects. The expanded theorem has biological implications significantly different from what Fisher had envisioned.},

  abstract = {Two giants of evolutionary theory, Sewall Wright and R. A. Fisher, fought bitterly for over thirty years. The Wright-Fisher controversy forms a cornerstone of the history and philosophy of biology. I argue that the standard interpretations of the Wright-Fisher controversy do not accurately represent the ideas and arguments of these two key historical figures. The usual account contrasts the major slogans attached to each name: Wright's adaptive landscape and shifting balance theory of evolution versus Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. These alternative theories are in fact incommensurable. Wright's theory is a detailed dynamical model of evolutionary change in actual populations. Fisher's theory is an abstract invariance and conservation law that, like all physical laws, captures essential features of a system but does not account for all aspects of dynamics in real examples. This key contrast between embodied theories of real cases and abstract laws is missing from prior analyses of Wright versus Fisher. They never argued about this contrast. Instead, the issue at stake in their arguments concerned the actual dynamics of real populations. Both agreed that fluctuations of nonadditive (epistatic) gene combinations play a central role in evolution. Wright emphasized stochastic fluctuations of gene combinations in small, isolated populations. By contrast, Fisher believed that fluctuating selection in large populations was the main cause of fluctuation in nonadditive gene combinations. Close reading shows that widely cited views attributed to Fisher mostly come from what Wright said about Fisher, whereas Fisher's own writings clearly do not support such views.},

  journal = {PLoS Genetics}, 
  abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and two inflammatory bowel disease datasets. This analysis uncovers a number of putative signals of local adaptation, and we discuss the biological interpretation and caveats of these results.},

We found complex hierarchical genetic structure created by altitude, dispersal events, and admixture among subspecies, which complicated identification of locally beneficial alleles. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium revealed four large putative inversion polymorphisms showing clinal patterns of frequency. Population differentiation and environmental correlations suggest that both inversions and intergenic polymorphisms are involved in local adaptation.},

We tested this proposition in the global food crop Sorghum bicolor, characterizing 1943 georeferenced landraces at 404,627 SNPs and quantifying allelic associations with bioclimatic and soil gradients. Environment explained a substantial portion of SNP variation, independent of geographical distance, and genic SNPs were enriched for environmental associations. Further, environment-associated SNPs predicted genotype-by-environment interactions under experimental drought stress and aluminum toxicity. Our results suggest that genomic signatures of environmental adaptation may be useful for crop improvement, enhancing germplasm identification and marker-assisted selection.

  abstract = {Within-patient HIV populations evolve rapidly because of a high mutation rate, short generation time, and strong positive selection pressures. Previous studies have identified “consistent patterns” of viral sequence evolution. Just before HIV infection progresses to AIDS, evolution seems to slow markedly, and the genetic diversity of the viral population drops. This evolutionary slowdown could be caused either by a reduction in the average viral replication rate or because selection pressures weaken with the collapse of the immune system. The former hypothesis (which we denote “cellular exhaustion”) predicts a simultaneous reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis (denoted “immune relaxation”) predicts that only nonsynonymous evolution will slow. In this paper, we present a set of statistical procedures for distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses using DNA sequences sampled over the course of infection. The first component is a new method for estimating evolutionary rates that takes advantage of the temporal information in longitudinal DNA sequence samples. Second, we develop a set of probability models for the analysis of evolutionary rates in HIV populations in vivo. Application of these models to both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution affords a comparison of the cellular-exhaustion and immune-relaxation hypotheses. We apply the procedures to longitudinal data sets in which sequences of the env gene were sampled over the entire course of infection. Our analyses (1) statistically confirm that an evolutionary slowdown occurs late in infection, (2) strongly support the immune-relaxation hypothesis, and (3) indicate that the cessation of nonsynonymous evolution is associated with disease progression.},

Haplotype analysis revealed that the predominant mutation originated in the japonica subspecies and crossed both geographic and sterility barriers to move into the indica subspecies. A little less than one Mb of japonica DNA hitchhiked with the rc allele into most indica varieties, suggesting that other linked domestication alleles may have been transferred from japonica to indica along with white pericarp color. Our finding provides evidence of active cultural exchange among ancient farmers over the course of rice domestication coupled with very strong, positive selection for a single white allele in both subspecies of O. sativa.},

Among the several explanations of HIV disease progression, most include adaptation of the viral genome to the host environment as a causal factor. Therefore, quantifying the rate and pattern of adaptive evolution within infected patients is critical to understanding the development of AIDS. Using sequence data from infected individuals sampled at multiple time points, I estimate the within-host adaptation rate of the HIV-1 env gene for viral populations from 50 different patients. I find that, averaging across patients, one adaptive substitution occurs every 3.3 months. Also, one adaptive mutation is driven to a high frequency (>50% but <100%) every 2.5 months. Taken together, such adaptive events occur once every 25 viral generations, which is the fastest adaptation rate ever recorded for a single protein-coding gene. Within the entire env gene, I estimate that a majority (∼55%) of both nonsynonymous substitutions and high-frequency polymorphisms are adaptive. Further, in the C2-V5 region of env, I find that patients with longer asymptomatic periods have virus populations with higher adaptation rates, corroborating the notion that a broad, strong immune response against epitopes in the env gene product leads to longer asymptomatic periods. I conclude by discussing the distribution of nonsynonymous changes over the env gene.},

  journal = {Molecular Biology and Evolution}, 
  abstract = {Understanding the proximate and ultimate causes underlying the evolution of nucleotide composition in mammalian genomes is of fundamental interest to the study of molecular evolution. Comparative genomics studies have revealed that many more substitutions occur from G and C nucleotides to A and T nucleotides than the reverse, suggesting that mammalian genomes are not at equilibrium for base composition. Analysis of human polymorphism data suggests that mutations that increase GC-content tend to be at much higher frequencies than those that decrease or preserve GC-content when the ancestral allele is inferred via parsimony using the chimpanzee genome. These observations have been interpreted as evidence for a fixation bias in favor of G and C alleles due to either positive natural selection or biased gene conversion. Here, we test the robustness of this interpretation to violations of the parsimony assumption using a data set of 21,488 noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) SNPs project via direct resequencing of n = 95 individuals. Applying standard nonparametric and parametric population genetic approaches, we replicate the signatures of a fixation bias in favor of G and C alleles when the ancestral base is assumed to be the base found in the chimpanzee outgroup. However, upon taking into account the probability of misidentifying the ancestral state of each SNP using a context-dependent mutation model, the corrected distribution of SNP frequencies for GC-content increasing SNPs are nearly indistinguishable from the patterns observed for other types of mutations, suggesting that the signature of fixation bias is a spurious artifact of the parsimony assumption.},

We report the patterns of DNA sequence variation in rice and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon, across 111 randomly chosen gene fragments, and use these to infer the evolutionary dynamics that led to the origins of rice. There is a genome-wide excess of high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in O. sativa varieties, a pattern that has not been reported for other crop species. We developed several alternative models to explain contemporary patterns of polymorphisms in rice, including a (i) selectively neutral population bottleneck model, (ii) bottleneck plus migration model, (iii) multiple selective sweeps model, and (iv) bottleneck plus selective sweeps model. We find that a simple bottleneck model, which has been the dominant demographic model for domesticated species, cannot explain the derived nucleotide polymorphism site frequency spectrum in rice. Instead, a bottleneck model that incorporates selective sweeps, or a more complex demographic model that includes subdivision and gene flow, are more plausible explanations for patterns of variation in domesticated rice varieties. If selective sweeps are indeed the explanation for the observed nucleotide data of domesticated rice, it suggests that strong selection can leave its imprint on genome-wide polymorphism patterns, contrary to expectations that selection results only in a local signature of variation.},

Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

  abstract = {Population genetic analyses often use polymorphism data from one species, and orthologous genomic sequences from closely related outgroup species. These outgroup sequences are frequently used to identify ancestral alleles at segregating sites and to compare the patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Inherent in such studies is the assumption of parsimony, which posits that the ancestral state of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the allele that matches the orthologous site in the outgroup sequence, and that all nucleotide substitutions between species have been observed. This study tests the effect of violating the parsimony assumption when mutation rates vary across sites and over time. Using a context-dependent mutation model that accounts for elevated mutation rates at CpG dinucleotides, increased propensity for transitional versus transversional mutations, as well as other directional and contextual mutation biases estimated along the human lineage, we show (using both simulations and a theoretical model) that enough unobserved substitutions could have occurred since the divergence of human and chimpanzee to cause many statistical tests to spuriously reject neutrality. Moreover, using both the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genomes to parsimoniously identify ancestral states causes a large fraction of the data to be removed while not completely alleviating problem. By constructing a novel model of the context-dependent mutation process, we can correct polymorphism data for the effect of ancestral misidentification using a single outgroup.},

This model provides a maximum-likelihood framework for estimating both selection and dominance parameters of new mutations using information on the frequency spectrum of sequence polymorphisms. This is the first DNA sequence-based estimator of the dominance parameter. Our model also leads to a likelihood-ratio test for distinguishing nongenic from genic selection; simulations indicate that this test is quite powerful when a large number of segregating sites are available. We also use simulations to explore the bias in selection parameter estimates caused by unacknowledged dominance relations. When inference is based on the frequency spectrum of polymorphisms, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter can be very strongly biased even for minor deviations from the genic selection model. Surprisingly, however, when inference is based on polymorphism and divergence (McDonald-Kreitman) data, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter are nearly unbiased, even for completely dominant or recessive mutations. Further, we find that weak overdominant selection can increase, rather than decrease, the substitution rate relative to levels of polymorphism.

Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27–29% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|<0.01%), 30–42% are moderately deleterious (0.01%<|s|<1%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (|s|>1%). Our results are consistent with 10–20% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

  abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40–270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95% c.i.: 17–43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95% c.i.: 16.3–26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

This “SNP discovery” sample may be quite variable in size and composition, and it has been well established that properties of the SNPs that are found are influenced by the discovery sampling effort. The International HapMap project relied on nearly any piece of information available to identify SNPs—including BAC end sequences, shotgun reads, and differences between public and private sequences—and even made use of chimpanzee data to confirm human sequence differences. In addition, the ascertainment criteria shifted from using only SNPs that had been validated in population samples, to double-hit SNPs, to finally accepting SNPs that were singletons in small discovery samples. In contrast, Perlegen's primary discovery was a resequencing-by-hybridization effort using the 24 people of diverse origin in the Polymorphism Discovery Resource. Here we take these two data sets and contrast two basic summary statistics, heterozygosity and FST, as well as the site frequency spectra, for 500-kb windows spanning the genome. The magnitude of disparity between these samples in these measures of variability indicates that population genetic analysis on the raw genotype data is ill advised. Given the knowledge of the discovery samples, we perform an ascertainment correction and show how the post-correction data are more consistent across these studies. However, discrepancies persist, suggesting that the heterogeneity in the SNP discovery process of the HapMap project resulted in a data set resistant to complete ascertainment correction. Ascertainment bias will likely erode the power of tests of association between SNPs and complex disorders, but the effect will likely be small, and perhaps more importantly, it is unlikely that the bias will introduce false-positive inferences.},

  abstract = {Nonrandom mating induces correlations in allelic states within and among loci that can be exploited to understand the genetic structure of natural populations (Wright 1965). For many species, it is of considerable interest to quantify the contribution of two forms of nonrandom mating to patterns of standing genetic variation: inbreeding (mating among relatives) and population substructure (limited dispersal of gametes). Here, we extend the popular Bayesian clustering approach STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) for simultaneous inference of inbreeding or selfing rates and population-of-origin classification using multilocus genetic markers. This is accomplished by eliminating the assumption of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium within clusters and, instead, calculating expected genotype frequencies on the basis of inbreeding or selfing rates. We demonstrate the need for such an extension by showing that selfing leads to spurious signals of population substructure using the standard STRUCTURE algorithm with a bias toward spurious signals of admixture. We gauge the performance of our method using extensive coalescent simulations and demonstrate that our approach can correct for this bias. We also apply our approach to understanding the population structure of the wild relative of domesticated rice, Oryza rufipogon, an important partially selfing grass species. Using a sample of n = 16 individuals sequenced at 111 random loci, we find strong evidence for existence of two subpopulations, which correlates well with geographic location of sampling, and estimate selfing rates for both groups that are consistent with estimates from experimental data (s ≈ 0.48–0.70).},

  abstract = {Author Summary A selective sweep is a single realization of adaptive evolution at the molecular level. When a selective sweep occurs, it leaves a characteristic signal in patterns of variation in genomic regions linked to the selected site; therefore, recently released population genomic datasets can be used to search for instances of molecular adaptation. Here, we present a comprehensive scan for complete selective sweeps in the human genome. Our analysis is complementary to several recent analyses that focused on partial selective sweeps, in which the adaptive mutation still segregates at intermediate frequency in the population. Consequently, our analysis identifies many genomic regions that were not previously known to have experienced natural selection, including consistent evidence of selection in centromeric regions, which is possibly the result of meiotic drive. Genes within selected regions include pigmentation candidate genes, genes of the dystrophin protein complex, and olfactory receptors. Extensive testing demonstrates that the method we use to detect selective sweeps is strikingly robust to both alternative demographic scenarios and recombination rate variation. Furthermore, the method we use provides precise estimates of the genomic position of the selected site, which greatly facilitates the fine-scale mapping of functionally significant variation in human populations.},

  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, 
  abstract = {Photosynthetic membranes of higher plants contain specific nonphosphorous lipids like the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol in addition to the ubiquitous phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol. In bacteria, an environmental factor that drastically affects thylakoid lipid composition appears to be the availability of phosphate. Accordingly, we discovered an increase in the relative amount of sulfolipid and a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylglycerol in Arabidopsis thaliana grown on medium with reduced amounts of phosphate, as well as in the pho1 mutant of A. thaliana deficient in phosphate transport. To investigate the molecular basis of the observed change in lipid composition, we isolated a cDNA of A. thaliana, designated SQD1, that encodes a protein involved in sulfolipid biosynthesis as suggested by three lines of evidence. First, the cDNA shows high sequence similarity to bacterial sqdB genes known to be essential for sulfolipid biosynthesis; second, the SQD1 gene product is imported into chloroplasts where sulfolipid biosynthesis takes place; and third, transgenic plants expressing SQD1 in antisense orientation show a reduction in sulfolipid content. In the pho1 mutant as well as in wild-type plants grown under reduced phosphate availability, increased amounts of SQD1 mRNA and SQD1 protein are detected, suggesting that the increase in sulfolipid content under phosphate limitation is the result of an increased expression of at least one gene required for sulfolipid biosynthesis in A. thaliana. It is suggested that a certain amount of anionic thylakoid lipid is maintained by substituting sulfolipid for phosphatidylglycerol under reduced phosphate availability.},

  abstract = {Higher-plant chloroplast membranes are composed primarily of four characteristic lipids, namely monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidylglycerol. Among them, SQDG is the only sulfur-containing anionic glycerolipid and is the least prevalent component of photosynthetic membrane lipids. SQDG biosynthesis is mostly mediated by UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase (SQD1) and SQDG synthase (SQD2). Recently, another essential gene for SQDG synthesis, UGP3, was identified using transcriptome coexpression analysis and reverse genetics. UGP3 is a novel plastid UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase that supplies UDP-glucose to SQD1 in plastids. In Arabidopsis, SQDG is dispensable under normal growth conditions but important in certain environments, particularly phosphate-depleted conditions. The function of SQDG under phosphate-limited growth conditions is highly correlated with the regulation of other plant glycerolipid biosyntheses. This review summarizes recent research defining the mechanism for SQDG biosynthesis and its biological function in higher plants, particularly under phosphate-starved conditions.},

The predominant replacement lipid is digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG). This paper reports that the phospholipid-to-DGDG replacement is reversible, and that when oat seedlings are re-supplied with radio-labelled phosphate, it is initially recovered primarily in phosphatidylcholine (PC). Within 2 d, the shoot contains more than half of the lipid-associated radiolabel, reflecting phosphate translocation. Oat was also cultivated in different concentrations of phosphate and the DGDG/PC ratio in roots and phospholipase activities in isolated plasma membranes was assayed after different times of cultivation. The DGDG/PC ratio in root tissue correlated more closely with plasma membrane-localized phospholipase D, yielding phosphatidic acid (PA), than with plasma membrane-localized PA phosphatase, the activity that results in a decreased proportion of phospolipids. The lipid degradation data did not reflect a significant involvement of phospholipase C, although a putative phospholipase C analogue, non-specific phospholipase C4 (NPC4), was present in oat roots. The correlation between increased phospholipase D activity and DGDG/PC ratio is consistent with a model where phospholipid-to-DGDG replacement involves formation of PA that readily is removed from the plasma membrane for further degradation elsewhere.},

Therefore, a comprehensive survey of global gene expression in response to Pi deprivation was done by using Arabidopsis thaliana whole genome Affymetrix gene chip (ATH1) to quantify the spatio-temporal variations in transcript abundance of 22,810 genes. The analysis revealed a coordinated induction and suppression of 612 and 254 Pi-responsive genes, respectively. The functional classification of some of these genes indicated their involvement in various metabolic pathways, ion transport, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and other processes related to growth and development. This study is a detailed analysis of Pi starvation-induced changes in gene expression of the entire genome of Arabidopsis correlated with biochemical processes. The results not only enhance our knowledge about molecular processes associated with Pi deficiency, but also facilitate the identification of key molecular determinants for improving Pi use by crop species.},

Methionine-derived GSLs (Met-GSLs) with diverse side chains of various lengths are the major GSLs in Arabidopsis. Methionine chain elongation enzymes are responsible for variations in chain length in Met-GSL biosynthesis. The genes encoding methionine chain elongation enzymes are considered to have been recruited from the leucine biosynthetic pathway in the course of evolution. Among them, the genes encoding methylthioalkylmalate synthases and aminotransferases have been identified; however, the remaining genes that encode methylthioalkylmalate isomerase (MAM-I) and methylthioalkylmalate dehydro-genase (MAM-D) remain to be identified. In a previous study based on transcriptome co-expression analysis, we identified candidate genes for the large subunit of MAM-I and MAM-D. In this study, we confirmed their predicted functions by targeted GSL analysis of the knockout mutants, and named the respective genes MAM-IL1/AtleuC1 and MAM-D1/AtIMD1. Metabolic profiling of the knockout mutants of methionine chain elongation enzymes, conducted by means of widely targeted metabolomics, implied that these enzymes have roles in controlling metabolism from methionine to primary and methionine-related secondary metabolites.

The Pi concentration in the solution of most soils worldwide is usually far too low for maximum growth of crops, including rice. This has prompted the massive use of inefficient, polluting, and nonrenewable phosphorus (P) fertilizers in agriculture. We urgently need alternative and more sustainable approaches to decrease agriculture's dependence on Pi fertilizers. These include manipulating crops by (a) enhancing the ability of their roots to acquire limiting Pi from the soil (i.e. increased P‐acquisition efficiency) and/or (b) increasing the total biomass/yield produced per molecule of Pi acquired from the soil (i.e. increased P‐use efficiency). Improved P‐use efficiency may be achieved by producing high‐yielding plants with lower P concentrations or by improving the remobilization of acquired P within the plant so as to maximize growth and biomass allocation to developing organs. Membrane lipid remodelling coupled with hydrolysis of RNA and smaller P‐esters in senescing organs fuels P remobilization in rice, the world's most important cereal crop. Phosphorus (P) remobilization is a key strategy for plants to acclimate to P‐deficient conditions but has barely been explored. This review explores the molecular mechanisms that drive P remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the world's most important cereal crop, feeding a huge segment of the human population. Recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanism underpinning P remobilization highlights the great potential for this process to be exploited in breeding future P‐efficient rice genotypes that are less dependent on P fertilizers.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9% and 25%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and “ancient” Asian breeds.

  abstract = {Evidence for adaptation to different climates in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana is seen in reciprocal transplant experiments, but the genetic basis of this adaptation remains poorly understood. Field-based quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies provide direct but low-resolution evidence for the genetic basis of local adaptation. Using high-resolution population genomic approaches, we examine local adaptation along previously identified genetic trade-off (GT) and conditionally neutral (CN) QTLs for fitness between locally adapted Italian and Swedish A. thaliana populations [Ågren J, et al. (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:21077–21082]. We find that genomic regions enriched in high FST SNPs colocalize with GT QTL peaks. Many of these high FST regions also colocalize with regions enriched for SNPs significantly correlated to climate in Eurasia and evidence of recent selective sweeps in Sweden. Examining unfolded site frequency spectra across genes containing high FST SNPs suggests GTs may be due to more recent adaptation in Sweden than Italy. Finally, we collapse a list of thousands of genes spanning GT QTLs to 42 genes that likely underlie the observed GTs and explore potential biological processes driving these trade-offs, from protein phosphorylation, to seed dormancy and longevity. Our analyses link population genomic analyses and field-based QTL studies of local adaptation, and emphasize that GTs play an important role in the process of local adaptation.},

  author = {Corrado, Giandomenico and Rao, Rosa}, 
  journal = {Diversity}, 
  abstract = {Landraces are key elements of agricultural biodiversity that have long been considered a source of useful traits. Their importance goes beyond subsistence agriculture and the essential need to preserve genetic diversity, because landraces are farmer-developed populations that are often adapted to environmental conditions of significance to tackle environmental concerns. It is therefore increasingly important to identify adaptive traits in crop landraces and understand their molecular basis. This knowledge is potentially useful for promoting more sustainable agricultural techniques, reducing the environmental impact of high-input cropping systems, and diminishing the vulnerability of agriculture to global climate change. In this review, we present an overview of the opportunities and limitations offered by landraces’ genomics. We discuss how rapid advances in DNA sequencing techniques, plant phenotyping, and recombinant DNA-based biotechnology encourage both the identification and the validation of the genomic signature of local adaptation in crop landraces. The integration of ‘omics’ sciences, molecular population genetics, and field studies can provide information inaccessible with earlier technological tools. Although empirical knowledge on the genetic and genomic basis of local adaptation is still fragmented, it is predicted that genomic scans for adaptation will unlock an intraspecific molecular diversity that may be different from that of modern varieties.},

Here, we apply analytical methods derived from DNA sequence optimization algorithms to Uto-Aztecan languages, treating words as sequences of sounds. Our analysis yields novel relationships and suggests a resolution to current conflicts about the Proto-Uto-Aztecan homeland. The techniques used for Uto-Aztecan are applicable to written and unwritten languages, and should enable more empirically robust hypotheses of language relationships, language histories, and linguistic evolution.},

In addition to Darwin's curious parallels of process, there are a number of equally curious parallels and connections between the development of methods in biology and historical linguistics.

Here we investigate the Tupi expansion, a widely-dispersed language family in lowland South America, with a distance-based phylogeny based on 40-word vocabulary lists from 48 languages. We coded 11 cultural traits across the diverse Tupi family including traditional warfare patterns, post-marital residence, corporate structure, community size, paternity beliefs, sibling terminology, presence of canoes, tattooing, shamanism, men's houses, and lip plugs. The linguistic phylogeny supports a Tupi homeland in west-central Brazil with subsequent major expansions across much of lowland South America. Consistently, ancestral reconstructions of cultural traits over the linguistic phylogeny suggest that social complexity has tended to decline through time, most notably in the independent emergence of several nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. Estimated rates of cultural change across the Tupi expansion are on the order of only a few changes per 10,000 years, in accord with previous cultural phylogenetic results in other language families around the world, and indicate a conservative nature to much of human culture.},

Although first settled thousands of years ago and fitting its label as \"the New World,\" the European colonial expansion initiated in the late 15th century resulted in people from virtually every corner of the globe subsequently settling in the Americas. The arrival of large numbers of immigrants led to a dramatic decline of the Native American population and extensive population mixing. A salient feature of the current human population of the Americas is, thus, its great diversity. The genetic variation of the Native peoples that recent immigrants encountered had been shaped by demographic events acting since the initial peopling of the continent. Similarly, but on a compressed timescale, the colonial history of the Americas has had a major impact on the genetic makeup of the current population of the continent. A range of genetic analyses has been used to study both the ancient settlement of the continent and more recent history of population mixing. Here, I show how these two strands of research overlap and make use of results from other scientific disciplines to produce a fuller picture of the settlement of the continent at different time periods. The biological diversity of the Americas also provides prominent examples of the complex interaction between biological and social factors in constructing human identities and of the difficulties in defining human populations.},

We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

We also observe evidence of: (1) a higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America, (2) a relative lack of differentiation between Mesoamerican and Andean populations, (3) a scenario in which coastal routes were easier for migrating peoples to traverse in comparison with inland routes, and (4) a partial agreement on a local scale between genetic similarity and the linguistic classification of populations.

  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, 
  abstract = {Worldwide patterns of genetic variation are driven by human demographic history. Here, we test whether this demographic history has left similar signatures on phonemes—sound units that distinguish meaning between words in languages—to those it has left on genes. We analyze, jointly and in parallel, phoneme inventories from 2,082 worldwide languages and microsatellite polymorphisms from 246 worldwide populations. On a global scale, both genetic distance and phonemic distance between populations are significantly correlated with geographic distance. Geographically close language pairs share significantly more phonemes than distant language pairs, whether or not the languages are closely related. The regional geographic axes of greatest phonemic differentiation correspond to axes of genetic differentiation, suggesting that there is a relationship between human dispersal and linguistic variation. However, the geographic distribution of phoneme inventory sizes does not follow the predictions of a serial founder effect during human expansion out of Africa. Furthermore, although geographically isolated populations lose genetic diversity via genetic drift, phonemes are not subject to drift in the same way: within a given geographic radius, languages that are relatively isolated exhibit more variance in number of phonemes than languages with many neighbors. This finding suggests that relatively isolated languages are more susceptible to phonemic change than languages with many neighbors. Within a language family, phoneme evolution along genetic, geographic, or cognate-based linguistic trees predicts similar ancestral phoneme states to those predicted from ancient sources. More genetic sampling could further elucidate the relative roles of vertical and horizontal transmission in phoneme evolution.},

  abstract = {The relationship between linguistic differentiation and evolutionary affinities was evaluated in three tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Two tribes (Nuu-Chah-Nulth and Bella Coola) speak Amerind languages, while the language of the third (Haida) belongs to a different linguistic phylum--Na-Dene. Construction of a molecular phylogeny gave no evidence of clustering by linguistic affiliation, suggesting a relatively recent ancestry of these linguistically divergent populations. When the evolutionary affinities of the tribes were evaluated in terms of mitochondrial sequence diversity, the Na-Dene-speaking Haida had a reduced amount of diversity compared to the two Amerind tribes and thus appear to be a biologically younger population. Further, since the sequence diversity between the two Amerind-speaking tribes is comparable to the diversity between the Amerind tribes and the Na-Dene Haida, the evolutionary divergence within the Amerind linguistic phylum may be as great as the evolutionary divergence between the Amerind and Na-Dene phyla. Hence, in the New World, rates of linguistic differentiation appear to be markedly faster than rates of biological differentiation, with little congruence between linguistic hierarchy and the pattern of evolutionary relationships.},

  abstract = {Selective sweeps can increase genetic differentiation among populations and cause allele frequency spectra to depart from the expectation under neutrality. We present a likelihood method for detecting selective sweeps that involves jointly modeling the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect of a selective sweep on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity. We test the method with extensive simulated data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides higher power than previously reported approaches to detect selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization of the position of a selected allele. A strength of our technique is that it uses allele frequency differentiation between populations, which is much more robust to ascertainment bias in SNP discovery than methods based on the allele frequency spectrum. We apply this method to compare continentally diverse populations, as well as Northern and Southern Europeans. Our analysis identifies a list of loci as candidate targets of selection, including well-known selected loci and new regions that have not been highlighted by previous scans for selection.},

  abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

  abstract = {The timing of major phenological transitions is critical to lifetime fitness, and life history theory predicts differences for annual and perennial plants. To correctly time these transitions, many plants rely on environmental cues such as exposure to extended periods of cold, which may occur at different stages throughout their lifetime. We studied the role of cold at different life stages, by jointly exposing seed (stratification) and rosettes (vernalization) to cold. We used 23 populations of Mimulus guttatus, which vary from annuals to perennials, and investigated how cold at one or both stages affected germination, flowering, growth, and biomass. We found that stratification and vernalization interact to affect life cycle transitions, and that cold at either stage could synchronize flowering phenology. For perennials, either stratification or vernalization is necessary for maximum flowering. We also found that germination timing covaried with later traits. Moreover, plants from environments with dissimilar climates displayed different phenological responses to stratification or vernalization. In general, cold is more important for seed germination in annuals and plants from environments with warm temperatures and variable precipitation. In contrast, cold is more important for flowering in perennials: it accelerates flowering in plants from lower precipitation environments, and it increases flowering proportion in plants from cooler, more stable precipitation environments. We discuss our findings in the context of the variable environments plants experience within a population and the variation encountered across the biogeographic native range of the species.},

We created full diallel crosses among seven parents, originating from Southern Germany, and analysed the inheritance patterns in primary and secondary metabolism as well as in rosette size in situ. In comparison to primary metabolites, compounds from secondary metabolism were more variable and showed more pronounced non-additive inheritance patterns which could be attributed to epistasis. In addition, we showed that glucosinolates, among other secondary metabolites, were positively correlated with a proxy for plant size. Therefore, our study demonstrates that heterozygosity in local A. thaliana population generates metabolic variation and may impact several tasks directly linked to metabolism.},

  abstract = {Selection during evolution, whether natural or artificial, acts through the phenotype. For multifaceted phenotypes such as plant and inflorescence architecture, the underlying genetic architecture is composed of a complex network of interacting genes rather than single genes that act independently to determine the trait. As such, selection acts on entire gene networks. Here, we begin to define the genetic regulatory network to which the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1 (tb1), belongs. Using a combination of molecular methods to uncover either direct or indirect regulatory interactions, we identified a set of genes that lie downstream of tb1 in a gene network regulating both plant and inflorescence architecture. Additional genes, known from the literature, also act in this network. We observed that tb1 regulates both core cell cycle genes and another maize domestication gene, teosinte glume architecture1 (tga1). We show that several members of the MADS-box gene family are either directly or indirect regulated by tb1 and/or tga1, and that tb1 sits atop a cascade of transcriptional regulators controlling both plant and inflorescence architecture. Multiple members of the tb1 network appear to have been the targets of selection during maize domestication. Knowledge of the regulatory hierarchies controlling traits is central to understanding how new morphologies evolve.},

  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, 
  abstract = {Axillary branch suppression is a favorable trait bred into many domesticated crop plants including maize compared with its highly branched wild ancestor teosinte. Branch suppression in maize was achieved through selection of a gain of function allele of the teosinte branched1 (tb1) transcription factor that acts as a repressor of axillary bud growth. Previous work indicated that other loci may function epistatically with tb1 and may be responsible for some of its phenotypic effects. Here, we show that tb1 mediates axillary branch suppression through direct activation of the tassels replace upper ears1 (tru1) gene that encodes an ankyrin repeat domain protein containing a BTB/POZ motif necessary for protein–protein interactions. The expression of TRU1 and TB1 overlap in axillary buds, and TB1 binds to two locations in the tru1 gene as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shifts. In addition, nucleotide diversity surveys indicate that tru1, like tb1, was a target of selection. In modern maize, TRU1 is highly expressed in the leaf trace vasculature of axillary internodes, while in teosinte, this expression is highly reduced or absent. This increase in TRU1 expression levels in modern maize is supported by comparisons of relative protein levels with teosinte as well as by quantitative measurements of mRNA levels. Hence, a major innovation in creating ideal maize plant architecture originated from ectopic overexpression of tru1 in axillary branches, a critical step in mediating the effects of domestication by tb1.},

  journal = {Geoderma}, 
  abstract = {The soil quality paradigm was originally developed in the temperate region with the overarching objective of approaching air quality and water quality standards. Although holistic and systems-oriented, soil quality focused principally on issues arising from large nutrient and energy inputs to agricultural lands. Soil quality in the tropics, however, focuses on three overarching concerns: food insecurity, rural poverty and ecosystem degradation. Soil science in the tropics relies heavily on quantitative attributes of soils that can be measured. The emotional, value-laden and “measure everything” approach proposed by some proponents of the soil quality paradigm has no place in the tropics. Soil quality in the tropics must be considered a component of an integrated natural resource management framework (INRM). Based on quantitative topsoil attributes and soil taxonomy, the fertility capability soil classification (FCC) system is probably a good starting point to approach soil quality for the tropics and is widely used. FCC does not deal with soil attributes that can change in less than 1 year, but those that are either dynamic at time scales of years or decades with management, as well as inherent ones that do not change in less than a century. FCC attributes can be positive or negative depending on the land use as well as the temporal and spatial scales in question. Version 4 is introduced in this paper. The main changes are to include the former h condition modifier (acid, but not Al-toxic) with “no major chemical limitations” because field experience has shown little difference between the two and to introduce a new condition modifier m that denotes organic carbon saturation deficit. Additional modifiers are needed for nutrient depletion, compaction, surface sealing and other soil biological attributes, but there is no sufficient evidence to propose robust, quantitative threshold values at this time. The authors call on those actively involved in linking these attributes with plant growth and ecosystem functions to provide additional suggestions that would enhance FCC. The use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) shows great potential on a wide range of tropical soils. The evolution of soil science from a qualitative art into a quantitative science has progressed well in the tropics. Regressing to qualitative and vaguely defined soil quality attributes would be a step backwards.},

In addition to proofing the most recent version 2 maize gene models, we show that a subset of these genes, those that were identified by morphological phenotype prior to cloning, are retained at syntenic locations throughout the grasses at much higher levels than the average expressed maize gene, and are preferentially found on the maize1 subgenome even with a duplicate copy is still retained on the opposite subgenome. Maize1 is the subgenome that experienced less gene loss following the whole genome duplication in maize lineage 5–12 million years ago and genes located on this subgenome tend to be expressed at higher levels in modern maize.

Many factors, such as hormones, affect leaf inclination; however, how nutrition status, in particular phosphate (Pi) availability, affects leaf inclination remains largely unexplained. Here, we show that in rice (Oryza sativa), Pi-deficiency stress inhibits lamina joint cell elongation, thus restricting lamina joint size and inducing leaf erectness in rice. The Pi-starvation induced proteins SPX1 (named after Syg1/Pho81/XPR1) and SPX2 play a negative role in the regulation of leaf inclination. We further identified an SPX1-interacting protein, Regulator of Leaf Inclination 1 (RLI1), which positively regulates leaf inclination by affecting lamina joint cell elongation in rice. The rli1 mutants showed reduced leaf inclination and the RLI1 over-expressors showed increased leaf inclination. RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination. We also found that Pi-deficiency repressed the expression of RLI1. SPX1 protein interacts directly with RLI1, which could prevent RLI1 binding to the promoters of downstream genes. Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice.},

The tripartite hypotheses proposes that the ancestor of domesticated maize was a now extinct wild pod-popcorn; that teosinte originated from maize-Tripsacum hybridization; and that introgression with either teosinte or Tripsacum gave rise to the tripsacoid syndrome characteristic of many modern races of maize. Maize and teosinte cross readily, and exchange genes wherever they are sympatric. Hybrids between maize and Tripsacum are not always easy to produce, but natural introgression between these taxa is possible. However, artificially induced introgression from Tripsacum into maize failed to produce either teosinte-like offspring or the combination of tripsacoid characteristics assumed to indicate such introgression during the evolution of several South American races of maize. The available archaeological data seem to exclude teosinte as a possible ancestor of domesticated maize. This will make maize the only cereal without a living direct ancestor. Biosystematic studies suggest that teosinte is so closely related to domesticated maize that it could be accepted as the progenitor of maize.},
